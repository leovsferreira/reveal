SK-A-4081.jpg,"Dervish or Muslim saints held a special place in religiously tolerant Istanbul. Like Christian monks, some dervishes roamed the countryside or the city, while others lived in communities or orders. The most famous order is that of the Mevlevi dervishes, the followers of the philosopher and mystical poet Jalal ad-Din Rumi (1207-1273), also called Mevlana, our master. Mevlevi dervishes try to get in touch with Allah through prayer, music and whirling dance. Their right hand is raised in the dance to receive the heavenly blessing, which they pass on to the earth with the left hand. The followers of Mevlana lived in tekkes, also called Mevlevihanesi. Vanmour painted the Mevlevihane that stood near the Palais de Hollande in Pera. It was the oldest in the city and consisted of a prayer hall or dance hall (semahane), rooms for the dervishes, a room and a special prayer room for their leader the sheikh, a womens section, a library, a dining room and kitchen, a public fountain , a bell room from which the hour of prayer was announced and a cemetery. The ceremony began when the dervishes leader left his seat and stood at the edge of the dance floor to address his followers. Vanmour depicted him on the right of the painting in the contemplative pose he would assume throughout the ceremony. After this, the dervishes saluted their leader one by one, as the two men in the foreground do, and then they began their prayer. By spinning in circles in the same place to the rhythm of the music, they fell into a trance. The dervishes wear the distinctive cylindrical hat, the goatee, and long woolen clothes that whirled around them in a beautiful circle as they turned. On the balcony we see above left, a flute is played. Vanmour has depicted two spectators very prominently. They stand behind the balustrade near the chair of the religious leader and their features closely resemble those of Patrona Halil and his accomplice Muslu Bese. Why Vanmour depicted these protagonists of the Rebellion of 1730 so prominently is unclear. It does help us to date the painting, which must have been created between October 1730 (just after the uprising) and November 1730 (the murder of Patrona Halil and his associates)."
